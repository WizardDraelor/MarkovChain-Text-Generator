 I went down yesterday to Piraeus [a port, now part of Athens] with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess [Artemis] and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants [of Piraeus]; but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful.
